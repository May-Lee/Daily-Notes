## Define artificial intelligence
- Use of computing to detect patterns and make predictions
- Not intended as a substitute for human judgement
- Not creative in the true sense
- AI services
  - Analysis
    - can ingest enormous amounts of data
    - apply mathematical calculations 
    - sort and organize
  - Prediction
    - Comes from the analysis
    - "Based on this information, a certain thing will probably happen"

## Differentiate between AI and augmented intelligence
- Human Intelligence
  - Creativity
  - Generalization
  - Emotional
- Artificial Intelligence
  - Intake large amounts of data
  - Repetitive tasks with consistent results/accuracy        
- Augmented Intelligence 
  - Acts on human behalf but by complementing our capabilities
  - Such as a screen reader for the blind or voice-driven navigation

## Ai, Machine Learning and Deep Learning
- Artificial intelligence
  - Using an algorithm; programmed rules
- Machine learning
  - Training
  - Relies on exposure to data
  - Leads to a better model
- Deep learning
  - Eliminates need for feature extractions
  - No human input
  - Processes data (pictures) through different layers of neural networks
  - Layers learn an implicit representation of the raw data "on their own"

## What predictions can AI make?
- Human Language, using NLP
  - spelling errors
  - analyze queries to generate text
- Vision recognition
  - identify diseases
  - helps guides cars by reading signs and speed limits
- Fraud detection
  - analyzing normal purchase patterns to compare with fraudulent purchases

## Describe the three levels of AI
- Narrow AI
  - Focuses on addressing a single task, such as planning your day
  - Scaling very quickly in the consumer world
  - Enables robust applications
  - Must stick to the script for conversational capabilities
- Broad AI 
  - Midpoint between Narrow and General AI
  - Can handle a wider range of tasks than Narrow AI
  - Focused on integrating AI within a specific business process where companies need business- and enterprise-specific knowledge and data to train this type of system
  - predict global weather, trace pandemics, predict future business trends
- General AI
  - Can perform any intellectual task that a human can
  - Does not yet exist, as AIs cannot
    - Think abstractly
    - come up with new, creative ideas
    - strategize
    - respond to people with appropriate emotions
- ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence)
    - doesn't exist, would be a self-aware machine 
## Describe the history of AI from the past to the possible future
## Define and describe machine learning
## Differentiate between structured and unstructured data
## Describe how machine learning structures data
## Describe how machine learning structures unstructured data
## Describe how machine learning uses probabilistic calculation to solve problems
## Describe three methods by which machine learning analyzes data
## Describe an ideal relationship between humans and machine learning
